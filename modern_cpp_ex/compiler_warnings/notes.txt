Create here a main.cpp that contains some of the commen problems/issues that the
GCC compiler can catch.

# Display all warnings flags on g++
	g++ --help=warnings

# Good standard to compile with
	g++ -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic
	
#For visual studio
	/W4
#Warnings flags in VC have a different syntax then g++. Like
	/w14265
	/w14254
	...
#Note: There is an "-Wall" (/Wall) flag in VC but it produce a forest of warnings that makes it useless.
